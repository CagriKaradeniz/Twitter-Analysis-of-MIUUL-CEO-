# Business Problem
I got last @mvahitkeskin 3000 tweets with twitter.developer api and I analysed all his tweets with NLP method.
I chosen @mvahitkeskin twitter account because he share valuable informations about Data science and he is Co-founder of MIUUL.
I am strongly recommending to follow this account on twitter.
